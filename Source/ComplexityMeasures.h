\brief Extends from the ExtendedDataset class and implements all the complexity measures proposed by Ho and Basu (2002) and some new measures.

In summary, this class implements the following measures:
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li> Measures of overlaps in the feature values from different classes
            <ol>
                <li> Ratio of the maximum Fisher's discriminant (F1) </li>
                <li> Directional-vector maximum Fisher's discriminant ratio (F1v) </li>
                <li> Overlap of the per-class bounding boxes (F2) </li>
                <li> Maximum individual feature efficiency (F3) </li>
                <li> Collective feature efficiency (F4) </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> Measures of class separability
            <ol>
                <li> Minimized sum of the error distance of a linear classifier (L1) </li>
                <li> Training error of a linear classifier (L2) </li>
                <li> Fraction of points on the class boundary (N1) </li>
                <li> Ratio of average intra/inter class nearest neighbor distance (N2) </li>
                <li> Leave-one-out error rate of the one-nearest neighbor classifier (N3) </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li> Measures of geometry, topology, and density of manifolds
            <ol>
                <li> Nonlinearity of a linear classifier (L3) </li>
                <li> Nonlinearity of the one-nearest neighbor classifier (N4) </li>
                <li> Fraction of maximum covering spheres (T1) </li>
                <li> Average number of points per dimension (T2) </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <br>
    The implementation of the methods is organized into two .cpp files:
    <ol>
        <li> ComplexityFunctions.cpp, which implements all the functions of the complexity measures. </li>
        <li> SMO.cpp, which implements the sequential minimal optimization to train
            support vector machines (Platt, 1998). This is used as a linear classifier. </li>
    </ol>
