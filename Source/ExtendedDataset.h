\brief Extends from the Dataset class and introduces new functionalities.

The implementation of the methods of data set is done in a single .cpp file: ExtendedDataset.cpp
This class includes the following groups of methods:
	<ol>
		<li> Methods for organizing the examples per class and applying partition procedures. </li>
		<li> Methods for printing the data set in different formats. </li>
	</ol>
